## Sweet Tooth Bakery App

### Project Overview
The Sweet Tooth Bakery App is a Java console application that allows users to order bakery items, including cakes, pastries, and bread. Users can select a category, choose a specific type, specify a quantity, and view an order summary with the total price.

The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, including abstract classes, inheritance, enums, getters and setters, encapsulation, and method types (void, return, public, private).

### Features
Interactive console menu to select bakery items.

1. Supports multiple categories:

- Cakes (Sponge Cake, Apple Pie, Chocolate Cake, Birthday Cake)
- Pastries (Butter Croissant, Cinnamon Roll, Raspberry Danish Pastry)
- Bread (Sourdough, Baguette, Whole Wheat)

2. Quantity input and automated total price calculation.
3. Order summary displaying each itemâ€™s name, price, and optional custom note.
4. Polymorphic design: all items inherit from an abstract BakeryItem class.
5. Cleanly implemented enum Type with display names and prices.
6. Demonstrates private helper methods, public methods, void methods, and methods with return types.

### Running Instructions
